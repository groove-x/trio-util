        Use this iterator to coordinate some work whenever a collection
        or other stateful object is mutated.  Although you may miss intermediate
        states, you're ensured to eventually receive an event to process the most
        recent state.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)

        :param repeat_last: if true, repeat the last position in the event
          stream.  If no event has been set yet it still yields immediately,
          representing the "start" position.

        Typical usage::

            >>> my_list = []
            >>> repeated_event = RepeatedEvent()

            Whenever your collection is mutated, call the `set()` method.

            >>> my_list.append('hello')
            >>> repeated_event.set()

            The listener to continually process the latest state is:

            >>>     await persist_to_storage(my_list)

            If you'd like to persist the initial state of the list (before any
            set() is called), use the `repeat_last=True` option.
